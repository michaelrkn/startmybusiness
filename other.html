      <h1>Get insurance and a lawyer</h1>

      <p>At some point, you should get insurance to protect your company from the unexpected. You might forgo insurance at first, since with a new business there isn&#39;t much to lose (and you&#39;re personally protected from losses&nbsp;by your company&#39;s limitations on personal liability). However, you&#39;ll likely be required to get insurance if you get investors or lease an office, and you may want to consider getting insurance sooner depending on your business risks. We recommend <a href="https://www.embroker.com/" target="_blank">Embroker</a>, which makes getting business insurance simple. At the very least, you&#39;ll want to get general liability insurance; you may want other types of insurance as well, depending on your business. (Don&#39;t get workers&#39; compensation, as Gusto will take care of that.)</p>

      <p>Finally, you should get a lawyer. While lawyers are very expensive per hour, they will save you money in the long run. Before you propose a contract or agreement with anybody, and before you sign anything somebody else proposes, you should have a lawyer review it. Without a lawyer&#39;s help, you will at some point sign a contract that has unintended consequences that cost you far more than you would have paid the lawyer. And a lawyer can also help you identify parts of your business that might expose you to risk, such as having the proper personnel policies in place for your employees.</p>

      <p>One other tip for contracts, agreements, and leases: Make a folder&nbsp;in the same place you made your Business Documents folder, and any time you sign a document, keep a copy of it in that folder. While you&#39;ll rarely need to go back to those documents, it&#39;s really important that you are able to find them in case a dispute arises or in case you decide to sell your business and the buyer requests a copy of all of your contracts.</p>

      <p>That&#39;s it for starting your business! It&#39;s a lot to take in, but we hope we&#39;ve made it as simple as possible. Small businesses account for <a href="https://advocacy.sba.gov/2018/12/19/advocacy-releases-small-business-gdp-1998-2014/" target="_blank">44% of America&#39;s economy</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.sba.gov/advocacy/small-businesses-drive-job-growth-us" target="_blank">48% of its private employment</a>, and are the engines of change and innovation in our economy. Thanks for being an entrepreneur!</p>
