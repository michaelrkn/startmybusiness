      <h1>Prepare your company documents</h1>

      <p>While you&#39;re waiting for your state to send your confirmation, you can work on the documents you&#39;ll need right after the company has been created.</p>

      <p>Corporations are governed by a set of rules called their &quot;corporate bylaws,&quot; and LLCs are governed by their &quot;operating agreements.&quot; These rules decide when company meetings are held, how decisions are made, and how profits are allocated. Corporations and LLCs are required by law to have these rules. We&#39;ve provided a starting template you can use <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ymV4zjdLa67TIna49rtMDTtG2lL-nfFjtbt4ZpCWtAk/edit" target="_blank">here</a><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ymV4zjdLa67TIna49rtMDTtG2lL-nfFjtbt4ZpCWtAk/edit" target="_blank">&nbsp;for corporations</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Kh50LgbHdFlkM1SyG7U8vut5FhDLg8Qr7D7B8P5bCu4/edit" target="_blank">here for LLCs</a>. Make sure to talk with all your company owners about the rules and, if necessary, modify the template to everybody&#39;s satisfaction.</p>

      <p>After your company is formed, you&#39;ll need to have your first company meeting(s). We&#39;ve provided a template for <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SPfxFZqVbeWFU4qkTVAqy8YIA1dGlVVZgtKt-GAqwaw/edit" target="_blank">LLCs here</a>; for corporations, a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JUqNE5YnF-b7UP32QV73J_kgyc741tWiArIQPTtk-lI/edit" target="_blank">board meeting template is here</a>&nbsp;(do this first), and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1op2AHiw5J0HKkas51rRkUglN4YSa4KHLSyTf4LNAWEI/edit" target="_blank">shareholders meeting template is here</a>. At these meetings, you'll need to decide a tax year. Most businesses use a "calendar tax year" ending December 31. If another date makes more sense, such as if your business is seasonal, you can use a "fiscal tax year" ending the last day of another month.</p>

      <p>At every company meeting, you should keep minutes recording what happened at the meeting and store those minutes somewhere safe. If you like to use a service like Google Drive, OneDrive, or Dropbox for online file storage, you can create a folder called something like &quot;Business Documents&quot; to store your company files. In that folder, you can keep your bylaws or operating agreement, and make a subfolder called &quot;Minutes&quot; containing documents with each meeting&#39;s minutes.</p>

      <p>If your business is a corporation, you&#39;ll need to keep track of who owns how much stock. You can do so on a spreadsheet, but if you have more than a couple shareholders, it&#39;s a good idea to use a &quot;cap table management system&quot; like <a href="https://www.capshare.com/" target="_blank">Capshare</a>&nbsp;that will track changes in ownership.</p>

      <p>Corporations are required to have yearly meetings (LLCs are not). Make sure to do so in accordance with the rules set out in your bylaws, or you&rsquo;ll risk losing your status as a corporation, and the liability limitations it gives you. We recommend creating a repeating calendar reminder for yourself so that you don&#39;t forget.</p>
