      <h1>Obtain a tax ID number</h1>

      <p>Once the state sends you confirmation that your business has been created, you&#39;re ready to get going on the next steps! (Don&#39;t forget to have your first company meetings from the previous step.)</p>

      <p>When you register online, many states will provide you a PDF with your articles of incorporation (or organization). Save it in your Business Documents folder. If you are mailed a letter but like to keep your files on your computer, you can get a scanner app for your phone that will let you take photos of documents and turn them into scan-quality PDFs. Even if don&#39;t need a scanner app&nbsp;now, you probably will eventually, because the government unfortunately still does many things offline.</p>

      <p>The next step is to get a tax ID number, also called an FEIN or EIN (federal employer identification number). You&#39;ll need this number for many government registrations and even to open a bank account. Fortunately, getting an EIN is quick and easy, and you can do so <a href="https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/apply-for-an-employer-identification-number-ein-online" target="_blank">here on the IRS website</a>. When prompted, choose Corporation (and then S Corporation) or LLC, then &quot;Started a new business&quot;, then Individual. The rest should be self-explanatory. When you&#39;re done, you&#39;ll receive a PDF that you can add to your Business Documents folder.</p>

      <p>At this point, we&#39;d recommend you create a document in your Business Documents folder called Business Numbers. In it, enter your EIN.</p>

      <p>Another thing you can do now is figure out your NAICS code. While this isn&#39;t technically required, you&#39;ll need it for many government forms. You can look up your code <a href="https://www.naics.com/search-naics-codes-by-industry/" target="_blank">here on the NAICS website</a>. Then add it to your Business Numbers document.</p>
