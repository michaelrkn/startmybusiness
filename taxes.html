      <h1>Register to pay taxes</h1>

      <p>You&#39;ve already created your business with your state&#39;s government, but you also need to register to pay taxes with them. This is usually done with their &quot;department of revenue&quot; or similar division. You can typically do this registration online. Depending on your state, you may have had to create an account to file your articles of incorporation/organization; if so, you might use this system to register your business, or the state may have registered you automatically.</p>

      <p>When you register, your state will tell you how often you need to pay taxes. Some states will email you a reminder, but if your state doesn&#39;t have that option, you should create a repeating calendar reminder for yourself so that you don&#39;t miss your tax payments.</p>

      <p>After registering, your state will give you a state business identification number of some sort. You should add that number to your Business Numbers document for easy reference.</p>

      <p>Most local governments require you to obtain a business license. Do so after finishing your state registration, as your state business number will likely be necessary. When you receive your local business license, add it (or a scan of it) to your Business Documents folder. You&#39;ll also need to pay local taxes; again, if your local government doesn&#39;t email you reminders to do so, set a calendar reminder for yourself.</p>

      <p>Depending on what industry you&#39;re in, you may also need to obtain licensing and pay additional fees to your local, state, and/or federal government. For example, if you&#39;re starting a restaurant, you&#39;ll probably need health inspections from your local government to get a license to sell food, and you&#39;ll probably need to pay an extra set of fees for this license. Check&nbsp;the regulations for all levels of government for your industry to make sure you don&#39;t operate without the appropriate licensing.</p>
