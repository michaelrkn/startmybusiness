      <h1>Set up finances</h1>

      <p>From the standpoint of the government, you are now ready to run your business! Before you start any operations, though, you should open a business bank account. Not only does using your personal bank account make bookkeeping and taxes a nightmare, it risks your losing the limit on personal liability a corporation or LLC gives you. So open a bank account as soon as you have finished registering your business.</p>

      <p>If you don&#39;t need a branch, we recommend <a href="https://www.azlo.com/" target="_blank">Azlo</a>, as it has no fees and a great website. If you need to deposit cash, most banks are pretty mediocre in terms of their fees, customer service, and websites, but you might start by looking&nbsp;at <a href="https://www.chase.com/" target="_blank">Chase</a>, as their website and customer service are better than many other options. You also might consider a local bank or credit union.</p>

      <p>You&#39;ll also need to keep track of and categorize your income and expenses, both so you can file your taxes, and so you can understand your business&#39;s finances. Bookkeeping tools help you do this, and we&#39;d recommend&nbsp;you use <a href="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=960179&u=2076249&m=52946&urllink=&afftrack=" target="_blank">FreshBooks</a>: it is easy to get started with, and also has more advanced features that your business may grow to need. Set up an account with FreshBooks right after you open your bank account and do your books at least monthly, as it&#39;s much easier to do as you go than try to figure out months later (not to mention you&#39;ll need the information regularly for taxes).</p>

      <p>While Freshbooks makes it easy to do your own bookkeeping, you need an accountant to review your books and file your taxes. Pick out an accountant as soon as possible and well before you file your first taxes, as they can help you decide what accounting method to use, which will impact your tax payments. Your best bet is usually to find a local accountant&mdash;ask colleagues and other local sources for referrals, and talk with a few of your options (and ask their fees!).</p>

      <p>Assuming you have taken an S election, you are required to pay yourself a reasonable salary. When you&#39;re ready to pay yourself or any other employee, we recommend you use a payroll service. For most businesses, payroll taxes are too&nbsp;complicated to be worth your time, and there are affordable services that will handle payroll for you. We recommend <a href="https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1033685&u=2076249&m=71912&urllink=&afftrack=" target="_blank">Gusto</a>, which will take care of your payroll, benefits, workers&#39; compensation, and HR compliance. </p>
